As it is possible to lock bootloader with LineageOS installed, theoretically user can accidently damage system when bootloader is locked leading to soft-bricked device\nWhat I suggest is to use the following check instead of completely removing it:\n```C++\n// If bootloader does not report us anything about verified boot state assume\n// it is unlocked\nif (android::base::GetProperty(\"ro.boot.verifiedbootstate\", \"orange\") !\u003d \"orange\") {\n        LOG(ERROR) \u003c\u003c \"Device must be bootloader unlocked\";\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n}```",
