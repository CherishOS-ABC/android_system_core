      "message": "And queue_fs_event calls e4crypt_install_keyring here.\n\nTWRP needs e4crypt_install_keyring to be called and e4crypt_install_keyring must be called by the init binary or it does not work. (See Google\u0027s documentation here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras/+/android-7.1.1_r43/ext4_utils/ext4_crypt_init_extensions.h#23)\n\nIn TWRP especially, but probably any recovery really, we don\u0027t want to call mount_all and have partitions like /system mounted. Calling mount_all is the only way to get the keyring installed that\u0027s needed for decrypt.\n\nOf course, I totally understand if no one wants this merged in mainline and I\u0027ll abandon if so. Devs can always cherry pick if they need this locally.",
